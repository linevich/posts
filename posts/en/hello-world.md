Summary: Hi, I think I need to write something like this post and I guess nobody will read this, but it doesn't matter.
Draft: False

Hi, I think I need to write something like this post and I guess nobody will read this, but it
doesn't matter.

All information about who am I you can find [here](/en/pages/about.html) so I think there is no need
to introduce me twice, but my plans. I'm a FullStack Python Developer and I plan to post here some
notes and thoughts about Python, Django, Linux and all the topics I've interested in.

First of all, this helps me to better understand what I've learned, systematize my knowledge. I hope
it will improve my language skills because English is not my mother tongue, so if you find any
mistakes or things that can be improved, please let me know.

For some reason comments for English and Ukrainian version now displays to all of the articles, I
don't think it's a big issue but will try to fix it shortly.

My blog is powered by [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) with custom theme, all the stuff you
can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/linevich/blog).
