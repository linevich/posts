Summary: Should I learn Gentoo or it's system only for embeded systems proffessionals?


Nearly 1 month ago I installed Gentoo as my main OS (previously I have used Debian for 2.5 years)
and I think it's time to share how it feels to use it.

## Why to install Gentoo?

First and maybe main reason why, I think, do people install Gentoo

> Because I can! &copy;

You feel cool when you does things that other people can't and be proud. But as I can say after
one-two weeks you will have an irresistable desire to remove Gentoo and move back to the Ubuntu or
even Windows. Not enough motivation --- guaritee you failure.

The second scenario and that was one of my main reasons:

> I want to understand how my system work and be able to confgiure it.

Gentoo is a good motivation, but most of all lessons you start learn only with one word --- "F**k":

- F\*\*k it's no configured out of the box;
- F\*\*k I should reconfigure and compile kernel by myself to install drivers to my videocard;
- F\*\*k I forget to add USE flag and need to wait one more hour until it rebuilds;

Of course, a lot of things are automated and you will have, a lot of tools to do job, but first of
you should _read carefully_ all manuals, news (you will be noticed about it after portage tree
syncing --- similar to `apt-get update`) and [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page).
